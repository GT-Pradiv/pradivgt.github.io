                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>How the ITIL Change Management Process Saved My Team from a Major Outage</strong><br><br>Our team was ready for launch. We'd tested every feature, run through the deployment checklist, and prepared for a seamless release. We were all poised to celebrate, but within minutes, a different story was unfolding. The tickets started to flood in: "Payment failed." Then another. And another. All for the same reason.<br><br>This wasn't just a bug; it was a potential crisis. With every failed payment, we were losing potential customers and revenue. The clock was ticking.<br><br><strong>The Problem:</strong> <em>A Bug No One Saw Coming</em><em><br></em><br>The issue was insidious because it wasn't a flaw in the product code. Our internal logs blamed the customer's bank, showing a simple decline. But blaming the customer was not an option. We knew they wouldn't wait long. We had to find the real root cause, and we had to do it fast.<br><br>This is where ITIL's Incident Management comes into play. The goal is to restore the service as quickly as possible. I immediately set to work, not on fixing the code, but on solving the problem for our customers in real-time.<br><br><strong>The Solution:</strong> <em>A Data-Driven Approach</em><em><br></em><br>I started by applying a data-driven approach to an urgent problem. I filtered the payments to identify a pattern among the failures. Within minutes, a trend emerged: all failed transactions were from international customers using debit cards. This was the key.<br><br>I then ran a simple test using my own debit card and discovered the problem: my bank had disabled international transactions by default. This wasn't a bug in our code; it was an external factor that no one had considered during the test phase.<br><br>With the root cause identified, my focus shifted from triage to empowerment. In just 40 minutes, I had a clear solution.<br><br><strong>From Crisis to Competence:</strong> <em>The Final Outcome</em><em><br></em><br>I immediately briefed my director and the engineering team on my findings. My next step was to create two documents: one for our support team, providing a step-by-step guide on how to help customers enable international transactions, and one for the customer, offering a simple guide to resolve the issue themselves.<br><br>This action had two critical outcomes:<br><br><strong>Saved the Launch:</strong> We restored the ability for our international users to make successful payments, turning a potential revenue loss into a resounding success.<br><br><strong>Built a Knowledge Base:</strong> This wasn't just a quick fix; it was a permanent solution. By creating the documentation, we transformed a one-time incident into a resource that would prevent future occurrences.<br><br>This experience solidified my belief that true leadership lies in the ability to think strategically under pressure. It's about moving beyond simply "fixing" the symptom and instead diagnosing the root cause to create a robust, lasting solution. <br><br>This is the power of ITIL in practice.</p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">It was the kind of problem every leader dreads: unresolved customer requests were on the rise, and our response times were slipping. As ticket volume increased, so did the pressure on my team. The easy assumption was that this was a performance issueâ€”that our team needed more training or was simply not keeping up. But I had a feeling the real problem was deeper than that.<br><br><strong>The Problem:</strong> <em>A Deceptive Surge</em><em><br></em><br>The gut feeling was to double down on training and accountability. But I knew that was a symptom, not the cause. We needed to understand the "why" behind the numbers. I pulled data, analyzing the average time spent on each ticket. What I found was startling: the average resolution time was increasing, but it wasn't because of a lack of effort. It was because the overall volume of inquiries was overwhelming the team's capacity.<br><br>This backlog created a ripple effect. Customer wait times increased, leading to a rise in churn. The data showed a terrifying pattern: customers who waited more than 24 hours were far more likely to request a refund. This was no longer just a support issue; it was a business crisis. Sales were dropping, and the refund team was getting buried.<br><br><strong>The Decision:</strong> <em>We Are All One Team</em><em><br></em><br>The data gave me the clarity I needed to make a bold decision. I proposed a radical, cross-functional solution: we would temporarily embed members from the sales and general support teams into the refund queue. This was not a demand; it was a plea for collaboration.<br><br>My team, always customer-obsessed, understood the urgency. We modified access permissions to ensure security and transformed four separate teams into a single, unified unit. I worked directly alongside them, handling tickets and demonstrating my commitment. The goal wasn't just to process refunds but to see if we could solve the underlying issue and prevent them. We scored tickets where the issue was resolved and the customer was satisfied, effectively turning a "refund" ticket into a "retention" win.<br><br><strong>The Outcome:</strong> <em>Control, Retention, and Trust</em><em><br></em><br>The results were immediate and powerful. We regained control of the ticket queues, and refund requests became manageable. The team felt empowered, and the churn data began to reflect our efforts, trending downward. Thanks to the sales team's support, we were even able to re-engage with lost customers, offering them a better promotion to win back their business.<br><br>This experience proved that the most complex problems are often solved not by working harder, but by working smarter, and that a single data-driven insight can transform a business in crisis. It taught me that when you empower your team with purpose and a shared understanding of the data, they will rise to any challenge.</p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">The business was growing fast, and with every new customer, the pressure on my team intensified. The tickets were piling up, and the customer queue was growing by the hour. The most obvious solutionâ€”the one demanded by the businessâ€”was to hire fast to fill the backlog. I made the call to bring in six new people in a matter of days.<br><br>It was one of the biggest mistakes I ever made as a leader.<br><br><strong>The Myth of "Hiring Fast"</strong><strong><br></strong><br>In the chaotic world of a rapidly growing business, the impulse is to see every problem as a numbers game. You have a backlog? Just add more headcount. What I learned the hard way is that hiring fast is not a solution; it's often the source of new problems.<br><br>The moment the new team members joined, I saw a dip in performance. The competitive nature of the existing team culture was overwhelming, and the new hires struggled to find their footing. They were technically proficient, but they were not a cultural fit. We hired based on speed, and in doing so, we lost the very consistency and camaraderie that made our original team so effective.<br><br>I knew this wasn't sustainable. We had to pause, reflect, and change our entire approach. The next wave of hiring would be different.<br><br><strong>The Real Solution:</strong> <em>The Relentless Search for "Customer Obsession"</em><em><br></em><br>I realized that a great team isn't built on technical skill alone. It's built on a shared, unwavering commitment to the customer. So, I changed my hiring strategy entirely. We would still look for talent, but our primary filter would be "customer obsession."<br><br>I began designing interview scenarios that went beyond standard technical questions. I presented candidates with difficult, ambiguous customer issues and asked them to walk me through their problem-solving process. It was a test of empathy, grit, and out-of-the-box thinking. I was looking for candidates who were not only technically skilled but also genuinely driven to make the customer's life easier.<br><br>This process took longer. We had to spend extra hours interviewing and sometimes we had to pass on technically brilliant candidates because they lacked that critical "customer-obsessed" mindset. But the effort paid off.<br><br><strong>The Outcome:</strong> <em>A Team That Just "Fits"</em><em><br></em><br>Over the next month, we built a team that was not just capable but cohesive. They were consistent, they were fast, and most importantly, they fit our culture like a missing piece. They were a team that was genuinely excited to solve customer problems, and their passion was contagious.<br><br>This experience taught me the most valuable lesson about scaling: you can't build a great team by treating people like numbers. You build it by carefully, deliberately, and patiently finding the right peopleâ€”those who share your values and are as obsessed with the customer as you are. That's the only way to scale for true, long-term success.</p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">The traditional approach to onboarding is a one-way street: a new hire sits through a week of lectures and presentations, absorbing a flood of information. They are the "sheep," and the trainer is the "shepherd." This model is efficient on paper, but it creates a culture of dependence, where new team members wait to be told what to do.<br><br>I've always believed there was a better way. My philosophy on onboarding is simple: we don't just hire people to do a job; we hire them to become leaders.<br><br><strong>My Onboarding Philosophy: </strong><em>Sell the Mission First</em><em><br></em><br>Before we ever dive into technical training, I focus on one thing: making new hires fall in love with the product. I make them feel like it's their own business and their own customers. This isn't about money; it's about passion. When they have a genuine belief in the product's value, they transition from being a passive trainee to an engaged problem-solver.<br><br>Once that belief is established, the real training begins. I provide core resources, but I encourage them to do their own digging. Instead of giving them the answers, I ask them to find their own solutions and then confirm their findings. This "explore and confirm" pattern builds critical thinking, confidence, and a sense of ownership.<br><br><strong>The Mentorship Engine:</strong> <em>Turning Trainees into Trainers</em><em><br></em><br>The most impactful part of this process is when a new hire makes their own discovery. I ask them to present their findings to the next batch of new hires. This simple act creates a powerful feedback loop. It not only reinforces their own learning but also builds their confidence and public speaking skills. They are no longer just learning; they are teaching.<br><br>This system creates a self-sustaining cycle of leadership development. Within a few months, we have a team of not just members, but of trainers and, most importantly, leaders.<br><br><strong>The Outcome:</strong> <em>A Team of Leaders</em><em><br></em><br>The results of this approach speak for themselves. The teams I've trained are self-sufficient, confident, and constantly looking for ways to improve. They are ready to step up and train others, creating a culture of continuous learning and growth.<br><br>For over a decade, this philosophy has allowed me to build and scale more than ten teams of high-performing individuals who are not just excellent at their jobs but are also poised to take on leadership roles themselves.</p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">When you're building a team, you're building a community, and every community has its challenges. I've learned that one of the most difficult situations is dealing with a team member who is struggling. It's especially tough when that person is a senior member, someone who should be leading the way.<br><br>I remember a specific case where a senior team member was falling behind. The data was clear: their performance was dropping, and the team's efficiency was suffering. My first instinct was to have a frank, data-driven conversation, which I did. The tough decision was to reduce their workload and re-assign tasks to someone who was performing better.<br><br><strong>The Real Challenge:</strong> <em>Managing Pride</em><br>I knew the conversation wasn't the end of the story. I knew this would be a hit to their pride and could cause morale issues with the rest of the team. I was right. The moment a senior's responsibilities are reduced, it can be seen as a lack of recognition. The talks that happen "unofficially" within the team can be far more destructive than any formal announcement.<br><br>My initial approach of simply reassigning the work wasn't enough. I realized that a leader's job isn't just to manage performance, but to manage the person. My job was to rebuild their confidence, not just to fix the problem.<br><br><strong>The Solution:</strong> <em>A Strategic Reset</em><br>I changed my approach entirely. When a senior team member's workload needed to be reduced, I would frame it not as a reduction, but as an opportunity. I'd give them a new, different roleâ€”a new challengeâ€”that would take their mind off the change.<br><br>This strategy served three purposes:<br><br><strong>1. It eased the pressure:</strong> By removing the underperforming tasks, I gave them a chance to breathe and reset.<br><br><strong>2. It built confidence:</strong> The new tasks made them feel efficient and valuable again.<br><br><strong>3. It maintained morale:</strong> By giving them a new responsibility, I prevented them from feeling like they were not recognized for their seniority or experience.<br><br><strong>The Outcome:</strong> <em>A Healthy, Competitive Culture</em><br>The outcome was a team that thrived on a culture of healthy competition. The senior team member was able to find their footing again and eventually took on additional responsibilities. The other team members, seeing this person get a new role and a new challenge, saw it as a path to growth. They were curious, and they wanted to get in on that "good name."<br><br><strong>This taught me a critical lesson:</strong> a great team isn't just a collection of strong performers. It's a team that supports its weakest link, rehabilitates it, and helps it grow stronger. A team that's genuinely competitive is one where everyone is trying to be better, not just to win, but because they know that their leader is invested in their success.</p>
